<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Sukanta Bala</h1>
<p align="center">
    Hello, I’m Sukanta — a Fullstack Engineer based in Berlin, Germany, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Telecommunication Engineering. I enjoy building meaningful web experiences that bring real value to users.

    With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I bring a holistic approach to problem-solving and product building.

    I graduated from Noakhali Science and Technology University, a renowned public university in Bangladesh. Both my degree and university are officially recognized by the German authority [ZAB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w9l2jASGbfYssJWfysJDZ9-exCEbzWW/view).

    Throughout my journey as a developer, I've built several useful and impactful projects — both for companies and clients. I'm always open to collaborating with fellow developers, creative minds, and forward-thinking teams. Let’s connect on [LinkedIn]!(https://linkedin.com/in/iamsukanta)
